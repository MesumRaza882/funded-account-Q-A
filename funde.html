            <li>Describe Your self</li>
            <p>
                My name is Raza. I am from Multan, Pakistan. Professionally, I am a web developer. I have been trading
                for 2 years as a day trader. </p>

            <li>what is Personal Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
            <p>
                "Strengths: I’m disciplined, patient, and calm under pressure.
                follow risk management, stay disciplined, and trade with a clear strategy.
                Weakness: I sometimes become too cautious and miss opportunities, but
                I am improving by trusting my plan."
            </p>

            <li>Where did you trade before applying for a funded account?</li>
            <p>Before this, I was trading on Exness with my personal account. I practiced day trading and
                learned how to manage</p>

            <li>Why do you want to become a trader?</li>
            <p>
                I come from a web development background, where I learned focus,
                problem-solving, and planning. I chose trading because it uses the
                same skills and gives a smart way to earn.
            </p>

            <li>Are you a competitive person?</li>
            <p>
                I focus on competing with myself, improving my discipline, risk
                management, and emotional control every day. Trading is not about
                beating others; it’s about being better than yesterday.
            </p>

            <li>What makes you different from an average trader?</li>
            <p>I trade based on structure, not emotion. I respect risk limits, avoid overtrading, and stay consistent
                with my routine. Unlike many traders who chase trades or gamble during news, I follow my process
                strictly, even when there’s no setup.</p>

            <li>If we fund you, how will you ensure you don’t blow the account?</li>
            <p>
                I will protect the account by keeping risk per trade low, never exceeding my daily or weekly loss
                limits, and sticking to my rules. I treat the funded account like a business, not a game, and focus on
                long-term growth, not short-term gains.

            </p>

            <li>Why did you choose us over others in the market?</li>
            <p>
                I chose you for the fast payouts, positive client reviews, and a fair profit share model — it fits what
                I look for in a prop firm.
            </p>

            <li>What’s your long-term goal as a trader?
            </li>

            <p>My long-term goal is to trade consistently, protect capital, and grow steadily. I want to scale into
                larger funded accounts and eventually become a full-time, self-sufficient trader who trades
                professionally without emotional decisions.</p>
            <li>Why do you think you will pass the evaluation?</li>
            <p>
                Because I have a proven trading plan, strict risk management, ": I trade with rules, not feelings. I
                know how to manage risk, so I believe I can pass the test.
            </p>

            <li>How do you plan your trading week ahead</li>
            <p>
                I review market conditions on Sunday, check economic events for the
                week, and plan trades from Tuesday to Thursday. I avoid Mondays and
                Fridays due to low volatility, and monitor daily news to adjust my
                strategy
            </p>

            <li>‌How do you stay updated with market news and events</li>
            <p>
                I check the daily news on Forex Factory and I also follow Rayner Teo
                on YouTube, which provides excellent trading strategies and market
                updates.
            </p>

            <li>How manage trades when markeet in high volatile?</li>
            <p>
                In high volatility, I reduce my lot size and wait for strong confirmation. I avoid trading news and
                always use stop loss to protect my account.
            </p>

            </li>
            <p>
                I follow simple strategy based on support and resistance, moving
                averages (fast and slow EMA crossover), and wait for confirmation
                using candlesticks patterns. once i get confirmation i entered the
                trade with proper SL and Tp. I also check Forex Factory for news
                before entering the trade and always set proper SL, TP with risk
                management.
            </p>

            <li>‌Moving strategy</li>
            <p>
                "I use fast and slow moving averages (like 7 EMA and 21 EMA) to
                identify trend direction. When fast MA crosses above slow MA, I look
                for buy setups; when it crosses below, I look for sell setups, with
                confirmation from support and resistance."
            </p>

            <li>Backtesting?</li>
            <p>
                Backtesting is testing a trading strategy on past data to see if it
                would have worked.

            <h2>Basic Trade Questions</h2>

            <li>What is your daily risk limit when trading</li>
            <p>
                My daily risk limit is 2% to 3%. During the evaluation, I may go up to
                3% to 4%, but with a live account, I’ll stick to 2% to 3% for better
                risk management and steady growth.
            </p>

            <li>How do you decide your lot size for each trade?"</li>

            <p>
                After setting the SL and TP, then calculate lot size divided by my
                risk amount by SL pips and pip value.
            </p>

            <li>
                What do you do if your first two trades of the day hit Stop Loss
            </li>
            <p>
                I accept the loss calmly, avoid revenge trading, and strictly stick to
                my rules and strategy.
            </p>

            <li>
                How do you control your emotions after a losing or winning streak.
            </li>
            <p>
                "I stay calm, follow my plan, and avoid emotional trading after wins
                or losses.
            </p>

            <li>How do you handle drawdown periods in your trading?</li>
            <p>
                I reduce my risk per trade, stay calm , review my strategy and plan
                and avoid emotional trading.
            </p>

            <li>What do you focus on more — win rate or risk-to-reward ratio?</li>
            <p>
                I focus more on maintaining a good risk-to-reward ratio because even
                with a lower win rate, consistent profits are possible.
            </p>

            <li>What is TP nad SL</li>
            <p>
                Stop Loss (SL): Automatically closes the trade when the price hits a
                set loss limit to prevent further losses.
            </p>

            <p>
                Take Profit (TP): Automatically closes the trade when the price
                reaches your desired profit level.
            </p>

            <li>Why you dont use 1:2 ?</li>
            <p>
                I don’t use 1:2 in the evaluation because it needs a bigger move and
                has lower win chances. With 1:1, I get more consistent wins while
                staying safe.
            </p>

            <li>‌Why do you want a funded account?</li>
            <p>
                "I want to grow as a trader without using my own capital. A funded
                account gives me the opportunity to scale my trading while following a
                disciplined approach."
