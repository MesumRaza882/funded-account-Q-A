        <li>Describe Your self</li>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Mesum Raza. I’ve been trading for the past two years as a day
          trader, learning through every win and loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          I come from a web development background, where I built skills like
          focus, problem-solving, and planning. These skills help me in trading.
          I follow a strategy based on technical analysis and strict
          risk management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m excited to work with a funded account because it allows me to
          trade with more capital and focus on consistent profits. I'm ready to
          follow the rules, pass the evaluation, and show that I can
          trade successfully.
        </p>

        <li>what is Personal Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
        <p>
          "Strengths: I’m disciplined, patient, and calm under pressure.
          Weakness: I sometimes become too cautious and miss opportunities, but
          I am improving by trusting my plan."
        </p>

        <li>Why do you want to become a trader?</li>
        <p>
          I come from a web development background, where I built skills like
          focus, problem-solving, and planning. Over time, I realized trading
          shares similar skills — discipline, decision-making, and patience. I’m
          passionate about learning new systems, and trading allows me to
          combine learning with smart earning. Just like coding, trading rewards
          consistency and improvement, and that motivates me every day
        </p>

        <li>Are you a competitive person?</li>
        <p>
          I focus on competing with myself, improving my discipline, risk
          management, and emotional control every day. Trading is not about
          beating others; it’s about being better than yesterday.
        </p>

        <li>Why do you think you will pass the evaluation?</li>
        <p>
          Because I have a proven trading plan, strict risk management, and
          psychological discipline. I am consistent, and I prioritize account
          safety over quick profits."
        </p>

        <li>How do you plan your trading week ahead</li>
        <p>
          I review market conditions on Sunday, check economic events for the
          week, and plan trades from Tuesday to Thursday. I avoid Mondays and
          Fridays due to low volatility, and monitor daily news to adjust my
          strategy
        </p>

        <li>‌Why do you want a funded account?</li>
        <p>
          "I want to grow as a trader without using my own capital. A funded
          account gives me the opportunity to scale my trading while following a
          disciplined approach."
        </p>
        <li>‌How do you stay updated with market news and events</li>
        <p>
          I check the daily news on Forex Factory and I also follow Rayner Teo
          on YouTube, which provides excellent trading strategies and market
          updates.
        </p>
        <li>‌Moving strategy</li>
        <p>
          "I use fast and slow moving averages (like 7 EMA and 21 EMA) to
          identify trend direction. When fast MA crosses above slow MA, I look
          for buy setups; when it crosses below, I look for sell setups, with
          confirmation from support and resistance."
        </p>

        <li>How manage trades when markeet in high volatile?</li>
        <p>In volatile markets, I reduce position size if needed, strictly follow my SL/TP, and avoid emotional decisions. I also check major news events and stay out if uncertainty is too high</p>
