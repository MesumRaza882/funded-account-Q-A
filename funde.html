        <li>Describe Your self</li>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Mesum Raza. I’ve been trading for the past two years as a day
          trader, learning through every win and loss.
        </p>

        <p>
          I come from a web development background, I'm excited to prove myself
          with a funded account by trading consistently and following all rules.
        </p>

        <li>what is Personal Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
        <p>
          "Strengths: I’m disciplined, patient, and calm under pressure.
          Weakness: I sometimes become too cautious and miss opportunities, but
          I am improving by trusting my plan."
        </p>

        <li>Why do you want to become a trader?</li>
        <p>
            I come from a web development background, where I learned focus, problem-solving, and planning. I chose trading because it uses the same skills and gives a smart way to earn.
        </p>

        <li>Are you a competitive person?</li>
        <p>
          I focus on competing with myself, improving my discipline, risk
          management, and emotional control every day. Trading is not about
          beating others; it’s about being better than yesterday.
        </p>

        <li>Why do you think you will pass the evaluation?</li>
        <p>
          Because I have a proven trading plan, strict risk management, and
          psychological discipline. I am consistent, and I prioritize account
          safety over quick profits."
        </p>

        <li>How do you plan your trading week ahead</li>
        <p>
          I review market conditions on Sunday, check economic events for the
          week, and plan trades from Tuesday to Thursday. I avoid Mondays and
          Fridays due to low volatility, and monitor daily news to adjust my
          strategy
        </p>

        <li>‌How do you stay updated with market news and events</li>
        <p>
          I check the daily news on Forex Factory and I also follow Rayner Teo
          on YouTube, which provides excellent trading strategies and market
          updates.
        </p>

        <li>How manage trades when markeet in high volatile?</li>
        <p>
          In volatile markets, I reduce position size if needed, strictly follow
          my SL/TP, and avoid emotional decisions. I also check major news
          events and stay out if uncertainty is too high
        </p>

          What trading strategy do you mainly use — trend following, breakout,
          or reversal?
        </li>
        <p>
          I follow simple strategy based on support and resistance, moving
          averages (fast and slow EMA crossover), and wait for confirmation
          using candlesticks patterns. once i get confirmation i entered the
          trade with proper SL and Tp. I also check Forex Factory for news
          before entering the trade and always set proper SL, TP with risk
          management.
        </p>

        <li>‌Moving strategy</li>
        <p>
          "I use fast and slow moving averages (like 7 EMA and 21 EMA) to
          identify trend direction. When fast MA crosses above slow MA, I look
          for buy setups; when it crosses below, I look for sell setups, with
          confirmation from support and resistance."
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Trade Questions</h2>

        <li>What is your daily risk limit when trading</li>
        <p>
          My daily risk limit is 2% to 3%. During the evaluation, I may go up to
          3% to 4%, but with a live account, I’ll stick to 2% to 3% for better
          risk management and steady growth.
        </p>

        <li>How do you decide your lot size for each trade?"</li>

        <p>
          After setting the SL and TP, then calculate lot size divided by my
          risk amount by SL pips and pip value.
        </p>

        <li>
          What do you do if your first two trades of the day hit Stop Loss
        </li>
        <p>
          I accept the loss calmly, avoid revenge trading, and strictly stick to
          my rules and strategy.
        </p>

        <li>
          How do you control your emotions after a losing or winning streak.
        </li>
        <p>
          "I stay calm, follow my plan, and avoid emotional trading after wins
          or losses.
        </p>

        <li>How do you handle drawdown periods in your trading?</li>
        <p>
          I reduce my risk per trade, stay calm , review my strategy and plan
          and avoid emotional trading.
        </p>

        <li>What do you focus on more — win rate or risk-to-reward ratio?</li>
        <p>
          I focus more on maintaining a good risk-to-reward ratio because even
          with a lower win rate, consistent profits are possible.
        </p>

        <li>Why you dont use 1:2 ?</li>
        <p>
          I don’t use 1:2 in the evaluation because it needs a bigger move and
          has lower win chances. With 1:1, I get more consistent wins while
          staying safe.
        </p>

        <li>‌Why do you want a funded account?</li>
        <p>
          "I want to grow as a trader without using my own capital. A funded
          account gives me the opportunity to scale my trading while following a
          disciplined approach."
